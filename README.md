# Curve Memory

This repository contains the core implementation of the Curve Memory framework, including robust hyperbolic geometry utilities for curvature-based memory encoding and dynamic geodesic computation.

## Overview

Curve Memory encodes information in path-dependent, curvature-sensitive geometries. This repo includes:

- ✅ Adaptive π geometry functions
- ✅ Robust handling of all curvature edge cases
- ✅ Utilities for geometric memory computation
- ✅ Unit tests and usage scripts

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from curve_memory.hyperbolic import pi_a_over_pi, adaptive_pi_metrics
```
