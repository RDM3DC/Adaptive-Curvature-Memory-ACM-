# Hyperbolic Extensions for Curve Memory (CMA)

Curve Memory (CMA) can be extended into **non-Euclidean spaces**, particularly hyperbolic geometry,
where curvature is negative and tilings (e.g. {p,q} tessellations) provide natural combinatorial structures.

## Key Ideas
- **Glyphs in H²:** CMA glyphs can be parameterized by geodesic arcs in the hyperbolic plane.
- **Frames:** Instead of SE(2), use PSL(2,R) representations or Poincaré disk coordinates.
- **Tiling Encoding:** Curves can trace tilings (e.g., {7,3} or {5,4}) with glyphs mapped to edges/vertices.

## Open Problems
- Efficient encoding of hyperbolic geodesics into CMA JSON format.
- Compression in hyperbolic tilings — wedge-product rules might simplify across fundamental domains.
- Visualization backends (Poincaré disk, upper half-plane).
