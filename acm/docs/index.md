# Adaptive Curvature Memory (ACM)

Adaptive Curvature Memory provides tools for dynamic curvature adaptation with persistent memory effects. It can be used in optimization algorithms or geometric computations.

## Modules

ACM is organized into several modules:

- **core** – the `AdaptiveCurvatureMemory` class for storing and updating curvature values.
- **models** – functions for manipulating curvature such as `adjust_curvature`.
- **utils** – helper utilities like `moving_average` for statistical calculations.

Example scripts demonstrating practical usage can be found in the `acm/examples/` directory.
