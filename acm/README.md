# Adaptive Curvature Memory (ACM)

This library implements a simple framework for maintaining curvature information with a short-term memory. It is useful for optimization and geometry tasks that require adaptive curvature tracking.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

```
pytest
```

Additional tests for the helper utilities live in `acm/tests/test_helpers.py`.
